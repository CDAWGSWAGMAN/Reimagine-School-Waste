        </ol></h2>
        If you are a high school student, join the green team and see if your school has an Interact Club, that club could provide the funding you need.  Request Service Learning Hours or even a school internship.  Look to volunteer a the local elementary school and ensure the refrigerator is clean and operating properly



Start with food recovery, then decontaminate recycling, start a Trex plastic film recovery program, where possible start a compost program at your school.



Lunch out of Landfills can connect you with students around the area and the country to help with ideas and support.


<br>
Note: As a student you are the constituent.  Everyone working at the school has a job to serve you.  Student voices are the most powerfulâ€¦ become empowered and be heard.  It is students that have the power to make change.
