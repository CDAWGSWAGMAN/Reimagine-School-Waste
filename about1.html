            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>
                Lunch Out of Landfill's (LOOL) mission is to enable students K-12 to become solution-focused change-makers to address our planetâ€™s climate emergency through food waste prevention. Our student-driven initiative incorporates a systemic change by introducing composting, effective recycling, and food recovery. Change starts here but continues for generations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, LOOL backs composting programs at over 20 schools throughout the nation. We are on track to have over 200 schools composting in the 2023 - 2024 school year!
